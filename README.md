In the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply (USDA). The best way to close this loop is through sharing resources so food isn't wasted. During COVID-19, the residents of my large apartment started leaving food resources in the hallway for fellow residents in need. **This inspired me to create giveall, an Android application to post food people no longer want or won't be able to finish on an app to share with community members.**
